          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="text">
            My name is Amit Nachimovitz.
            <br />
            I am a third-year Software and Information System Engineering
            student, at Ben-Gurion University. I've created this page as part of
            the first task in "Web Development Environments" course. Photography
            is one of the things in my life that put a smile on my face so I
            decided to dedicate this page to my photos. My hobbies include Judo,
            Crossfit, ski and scuba dive so basically everything that keeps me
            in movement.

          <h2>Q&A</h2>
          <h4>Three main differences between the Web versions:</h4>
          <p class="ans">
            Content:
            <br />
            In Web1.0, the content was static. it was one-way publishing of
            content without any real interaction between readers and publishers.
            In Web2.0, it started to act as a 2-way communication through social
            networking, blogging, etc. In Web3.0, AI and the web continuely
            learning what you want to consume and delivering you a personalized
            web experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Content Creators:
            <br />
            In Web1.0, Companies published content so that people can consume
            it. In Web2.0, people started to create and publish content so that
            other people can consume it. Furthermore, companies started to build
            platforms that let people publish their content in a more accessible
            way. In Web3.0, people also started to build applications that
            people can interact with. Companies have begun to build platforms
            that let people publish services by leveraging the associations
            between people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Search Engines:
            <br />
            In Web1.0, search engines retrieve macro contents. The results were
            very general and not specific. Search is very fast but many times
            results are inaccurate. In Web2.0, search engines retrieve tags with
            micro contents like pictures, links, events, news, Blogs, audio,
            video, etc. The process of tagging is manual. In Web3.0, search
            engines will retrieve micro-content texts which were tagged
            automatically. The results are more precise.
          </p>
          <h4>Well demonstrate those differences with the next scenario:</h4>
          <p class="ans">
            Let's assume we want to search for "Alter Bridge" band. Now let's
            compare the results retrieved by the search engines. In Web1.0, the
            search engine retrieved us pages that include the words "Alter
            Bridge", maybe even only one of the words apears in it. The search
            engine doesn't really know if the content inside the pages related
            to our query. There is a high probability that the results will be
            inaccurate. In Web2.0, as we mention above, search engines retrieve
            tags with micro contents. we could expect to get pictures, links,
            events, news, Blogs, audio, and video related to our query. The
            results retrieved are more accurate and more varied.
